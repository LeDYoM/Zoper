# Host Application Framework (HAF)

A C++ (game) application framework

This repository contains a framework to develop graphical and application
interactive applications. It is not the first one, that is known but it is
mainly a source of learning. So I try to accomplish some objectives:
* Use mondern C++
* Use modern design techniques
* Accomplish big modularity
* Use CMake in a modern and consistent way
